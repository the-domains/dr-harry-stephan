To my mind we are seeing the beginnings of a fundamental sea change within international politics.  Two issues, one political and one economic, should be considered: a). Iran is making all the right noises about coming in from the Cold.  If this new direction becomes a reality, then consider that the United States and Iran may once again become friends.  Immediately, Iran, and to a lesser extent Iraq, will begin exporting a lot more oil.  And (b). At the same time, fracking for natural gas in most of the world is becoming a reality and the United States, far from being a net importer of energy, will now become a net exporter of energy.  When these two issues are combined, the net effect will be a huge drop in energy prices.  I expect the price of oil to drop to $60.00 per barrel.  Perhaps OPEC will be able to limit the damage to $80.00 per barrel, but in any event, the drop in energy prices will act as a huge tax break over the OECD countries and we can expect exponential growth once again.  Even Italy, with its myriad political problems, may pull through. </p><p>4). If I may return to point (2), the current view of Europe is that the European Union is of paramount importance, and that Germany would never play outside the Union.  But consider this.  This summer, a German mandarin asked me why London became and remains the financial capital of the world.  Is it because Britain is a nation of shopkeepers?  Or perhaps because the Brits like bacon bits?  No the answer is far more mundane.  London can talk to the Chinese and the Americans on the same day.  The Americans cannot do this and it places New York at a distinct disadvantage. If we move from the financial to the production structure, then we are moving into the realm of global trade.  The German mandarin argued that Germany now found itself in a unique position because of high-speed rail.  The time taken to deliver goods by sea from Shanghai to Hamburg is 31 days.  From Shanghai to New York around 34 days.  Can you imagine the effect of a delivery time by rail from Shanghai to Hamburg of 34 hours, with onward shipping to New York in a few days?   </p><p>The effect would be astounding and it would make Berlin the new capital of the world.
