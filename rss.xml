            <title><![CDATA[One Minute to Midnight: Greece is Turning in the Wind]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>One Minute to Midnight: Greece is Turning in the Wind</h1><p>To my mind, Greece hit its 11th hour some time ago.  In fact I first started to make inquiries about Greek debt and posted on this subject in February 2013. I believe that the financial dilemma that developed in Greece epitomizes the failure of the European Union's mandarins to recognize that political solutions and political institutions are always necessary to run civil society.  Relying on an incorrect economic model through the ECB to correct fiscal imbalances is near to impossible, and the past two years have certainly proved this notion correct. Now that Greece is on the very edge, opinion makers are taking time out of their own schedules to pass comment.  Joseph Stiglitz, who is always worth a read, now has his say, and he certainly makes a strong argument below. </p></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[GREXIT: The Writing Appears to be on the Wall]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>GREXIT: The Writing Appears to be on the Wall</h1><p>There is no doubt that a Greek tragedy of modern proportions is upon us.  Regardless of the outcome, the blatant failure of Europe’s institutions and the mandarins’ continuing philosophy of austerity, epitomize the obstinacy and lack of vision that pervades the European Union today.  My thoughts have been enriched through correspondence from Jack Flattery, an economist in the United States, and a graduate student of mine, Tristan von Zahn.  Both agree that the sclerosis within the corridors of the European Union will prove its undoing.  Habermas prosaically refers to this sclerosis, particularly within the German leadership, as ‘the scandal of constipation’.  When will enough be enough to create a tipping point away from the madness?</p></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[POL 1004 Revision  Additional Comments]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>POL 1004 Revision  Additional Comments</h1><p>As we are approaching the final hurdle before the exam on Tuesday, I write for a few reasons.  First I would like to thank you for your generous and kind comments on your evaluations.   Second, I want to urge you all to put in that little bit of extra effort to ensure you will do well on the exam.  And third, I would like to provide you with a light interlude from your studies with a youtube link.  Had Plato been alive today, perhaps this would have been his world of illusion.   I am already looking forward to seeing you next year in POL 2039, so please make sure you pass this exam with aplomb!</p></article>]]></description>
