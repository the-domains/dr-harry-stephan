PP. 409-411. ​</strong></p><p>​The Scramble for Africa in the 21st Century: From the Old World to the New, edited </p><p>by Harry Stephan and Michael Power, Cape Town, Renaissance Press, 2012, 456 </p><p>pp., $9.99 (ebook) ISBN 9780987022004 </p><p>In this follow-up to their previous collaboration The Scramble for Africa in the 21st Century: A View from the South, Harry Stephan and Michael Power have produced an updated look at the continent. The newest edition follows the same structure and argument as the 2006 edition, but tells of an Africa that has witnessed major changes over the past five years. Stephan, a University of Cape Town-based academic and </p><p>manager of a large company, and Power, a global strategist at Investec, South Africa, </p><p>are more than suited to the challenge of producing a book of this nature, given </p><p>their experience in the business world, which no doubt improves the analysis of the </p><p>relevant theories of African political economy. </p><p>The central thesis of this book is that, with the emergence of China as a major </p><p>power and the re-emergence of a multi-polar international system, African states will </p><p>be in a position to argue for better trade terms among the competing powers. Much </p><p>of the book focuses on Africa’s economic history as a supplier of commodities and </p><p>on the international economic regime, run by the Bretton Woods system of the World </p><p>Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organisation (WTO), </p><p>which has pushed Washington Consensus policies onto developing countries to the </p><p>detriment of those countries’ economies. However, as Stephan states, ‘if the United </p><p>States begins to lose its hegemonic status to a multi-polar system, a new reality could </p><p>emerge which may not support the current consensus that has originated through </p><p>Washington’ (p. 20). </p><p>The book progresses through several stages in examining this possible change. </p><p>The first chapters are by Michael Power. Power starts by re-affirming the central </p><p>thesis of the book * that Africa can, and should, look towards the East for further </p><p>economic development, rather than continuing to look to the West. The reasoning </p><p>behind this is that, in the current Western-dominated global economy, Africa has </p><p>been commoditised, whereas in a global economy with the East as the centre, it </p><p>has not. Power lays out in great detail the life cycle of a product * from monopoly </p><p>to commodity * and then uses six different case studies, ranging from Microsoft </p><p>to Ford to Gillette, to explain how products eventually become commoditised. </p><p>This chapter was based on Power’s 2002 master’s thesis at the University of Cape </p><p>Town, although he has added updates on each company for 2011. He compares </p><p>Africa with Cargill, a company that markets, processes and distributes agricultural, </p><p>food, financial and industrial products. In 2002, Power believed Cargill to be in the </p><p>sixth and final round of a product life cycle, the ‘Sinking Ship’. He asks the question, </p><p>‘does the company have a secure future?’ and concludes that for ‘the likes of Cargill, </p><p>the end will most likely come when the family decide to pull the plug’ (p. 106). </p><p>However, in 2011, Power was proven incorrect, as Cargill was healthier than it had </p><p>been in 2002, thanks to Chinese demand for resources that it supplies. He posits </p><p>that Africa can do the same as Cargill and use Chinese demand as a stepping </p><p>stone to greater investment in the continent and increased economic development. </p><p>Power continues this Afro-optimism in his next chapter and comes to the same </p><p>conclusion * Africa can only escape the commoditisation trap via China. These two </p><p>chapters, which comprise almost a third of the entire book, are extremely in-depth </p><p>with many graphs and statistics to prove the argument. However, there is a definite </p><p>lack of focus on Africa, as it is rarely mentioned in the chapters, except in the </p><p>introduction and conclusion to tie it to Power’s original work. That said, Power </p><p>uses his extensive knowledge of economics effectively to show that, for Africa, like </p><p>Cargill, it is not yet time to ‘pull the plug’. </p><p>The Scramble for Africa then moves away from an emphasis on macro- and </p><p>microeconomics towards an analysis of the international political economy, </p><p>examining the role that institutions such as the WTO play in the international </p><p>trading system. As with the chapters penned by Power, this chapter by Raymond </p><p>Steenkamp Fonseca does not focus solely on the situation in Africa, but gives a </p><p>very broad and informative history of world trade institutions, starting with the </p><p>Bretton Woods institutions and their evolution via many United Nations </p><p>Conference on Trade and Development rounds, the New International Economic </p><p>Order and the evolution of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade into the </p><p>WTO. At the end of the chapter, there is an analysis of the role of Brazil, India and </p><p>South Africa and their multilateral agreements (such as IBSA), although the major </p><p>focus is on the role that the WTO plays in the global economy and the inherent </p><p>bias towards the North which disadvantages those states in the South. The author’s </p><p>conclusion, that the WTO needs to be re-examined and rethought to better ensure </p><p>fair treatment for those in the South, may seem idealistic to those with a realist </p><p>stance, but, like the other chapters, the Afro-optimism is tempered by the </p><p>admittance by the authors that the continent is still in transition and implementa- </p><p>tion is still far in the future. </p><p>This issue of an unequal international economy is expanded upon in the </p><p>following chapter on economic globalisation, arguing that the economic integration </p><p>that has occurred because of neo-liberal principles and ‘one-size-fits-all’ capitalism </p><p>has diverged significantly from what it was originally supposed to achieve. This is </p><p>one of the first chapters of the book that really analyses the issue from an African </p><p>perspective, as Stephan and co-author Michael Bridgman use Regime Theory and </p><p>Two-Level Games to explain how Africa may be able to overcome its traditional </p><p>hardships. The theories reinforce the basic argument of the book: that the current </p><p>economic regime, as detailed in the previous chapter, is detrimental to African </p><p>development. However, the rise of a secondary power, namely China, could alter the </p><p>current economic regime, led by the Washington Consensus, and the shift towards a </p><p>Beijing Consensus in Africa may cause those in the West to adapt to this new regime </p><p>to remain a player on the continent. As Stephan notes, ‘perhaps it was not aid that </p><p>was the trouble . . . [but] rather it was the prevailing style of aid which robbed Africa </p><p>of its autonomy and sovereignty’ (p. 291). This is important for African leaders, </p><p>who according to Putnam’s theory, have been playing on two game boards, one </p><p>national and one international. Leaders, such as Mbeki from South Africa, </p><p>struggled to please their domestic support base (notably labour), as well as the </p><p>international investors, who demanded neo-liberal conditions in return for </p><p>investment. With China now emerging on the scene, leaders will be less forced to </p><p>alter domestic policy in return for international investment. Stephan does deal </p><p>briefly with the issue of irresponsible governments in Africa, which many could </p><p>(and would) argue are equally to blame for Africa’s woes, conceding at the end of </p><p>the chapter that ‘the success of African countries is contingent upon African leaders </p><p>recognising their responsibility for the respective populations and the alleviation of </p><p>poverty’ (p. 297). </p><p>​</p><p>The penultimate chapter looks at how these leaders are dealing with the markets</p><p>which are embedded in globalisation and neo-liberalism, via regional organisations </p><p>such as the Southern African Development Community and the East African </p><p>Community. Like the other chapters, Angus Fane Hervey and Rochella Schollij </p><p>continue the Afro-optimist theme, despite the fact that many of the attempts at </p><p>regional organisation on the continent have fallen far short of expectations. They </p><p>point out, however, that ‘regionalism, if given the space it deserves to develop and </p><p>flourish in the continent, may not be a panacea, but can contribute, without dispute, </p><p>to Africa’s growth and development in significant ways’ (p. 359). This leads to the </p><p>book’s conclusion, by Stephan and Jessica Benjamin, which gives a political analysis </p><p>of the problems Africa faces, as opposed to the overly economic analyses of the other </p><p>chapters. The conclusion is simple: governments must invest in human capital to </p><p>continue to attract private investment. </p><p>Overall, this book is ideal for post-graduate students or those with a firm </p><p>grounding in economic theory and African politics. It may be a little technical for </p><p>those with only a mild interest in the subject, especially the first chapters by </p><p>Michael Power, which delve into advanced economic theory. The book is well </p><p>structured and builds upon the authors’ argument that the time is now for Africa </p><p>and, with a few changes in thinking by its leaders, real economic development could </p><p>be imminent, thanks to the rise of China as a major power in the international </p><p>system. Some may find this book too optimistic since it only briefly covers the </p><p>disadvantages of Chinese investment and influence in Africa. However, despite the </p><p>fact that the theory, case studies and statistics may be outside the average reader’s </p><p>realm, many will appreciate a serious book that is optimistic about the future of the </p><p>African continent. </p><p><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10220461.2012.741370" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dx.doi.org/10.1080/10220461.2012.741370</a> </p><p>Shawn Robert Duthie </p><p>Political Studies Department, University of Cape Town, </p><p>South Africa </p><p>Email: <a href="mailto:shawn.duthie@uct.ac.za" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shawn.duthie@uct.ac.za</a> </p><p># 2012, Shawn Robert Duthie </p><p>​</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="20"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="21"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="22"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="23"><span data-reactid="24"><!-- react-empty: 25 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="26"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="27"></a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="28"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="29"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="30"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
