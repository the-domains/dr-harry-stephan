Then third, I have found very interesting material on European culture that is underpinned by nationalism and the relationship of the member states to the EU.   The political leverage, either for convergence or devolution is quite fascinating, and takes me to my core problem right now.   This problem turns on the nature of political unrest within Europe and where this may lead.  There is no doubt in my mind that poor economic performance is leading to solid gains in Greece by the radical right, and we should see more of this within those  states that also begin experiencing economic decline.  Will this change dissipate if Europe can rebound?  Is the link real?    Is the economic structure within the EU governing political change, or can we flip the argument and maintain that political structures are causing the economic malaise on the periphery?  I simply don&#x27;t know how to formulate the connection.  My concern now is that France will soon become the sick man of Europe.  To my mind, this will result from a problem of France&#x27;s competitiveness within the Euro area.  Thus it appears that we shall witness more problems in Europe due to the straightjacket maintained by the single currency.  Will France balk and jump away or stay the course? How will this effect the political trajectory towards Balassa&#x27;s final solution of a single federated Europe? The alternative, France buys into Cameron&#x27;s notions of political and economic devolution. Something will have to give.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="6" class="Section Section--components-2 color-title title-size-medium  text-align-left  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="53"><div class="Component fx-c a-i-center p-2  color-box-pop-cycle" data-reactid="54"><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px max-w-768px p-1 color-title" data-reactid="55"><!-- react-empty: 56 --><!-- react-empty: 57 --><!-- react-empty: 58 --><!-- react-empty: 59 --><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="60"><p data-reactid="61">Thursdays, as always, involve graduate students.  Such a pleasure setting out arguments, but on this Thursday we debated the nature of regionalism in the East African Community, and especially the work of Eathan B.

 But as we probe the crisis of the EU in the 21st Century, can we honestly argue that nationalism is a dead issue?  In the period following the Great Depression we witnessed the rise of the Iron Guard in Romania, the Falangist movement  in Spain and Fascism under Benito Mussolini in Italy. What of Golden Dawn in Greece today, and can we argue with certainty that populists and parties of the right will not dominate politics in Europe again? </p></div><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="158"><p data-reactid="159">I want to invite you to argue a case for the European Union.  I see the issue as a fugue that requires arguments on both sides.  Nothing is simple.  Do we follow the &#x27;Oder Democracy&#x27; of Angela Merkel , for example, or has David Cameron struck a cord for devolution that will resonate through the corridors of power within the region? </p></div></div></div></section><section id="14" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title title-size-medium p-0 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  text-align-left  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="160"><div class="Component fx-c a-i-center p-1  color-box-pop-cycle" data-reactid="161"><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 max-w-768px m-a" data-reactid="162"><!-- react-empty: 163 --><!-- react-empty: 164 --><!-- react-empty: 165 --><!-- react-empty: 166 --><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="167"><p data-reactid="168">The European Union:  50 Years After the Elysee Treaty</p></div><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="169"><p data-reactid="170">Chapter I</p></div></div></div></section><section id="15" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title title-size-medium p-0 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  text-align-left  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="171"><div class="Component fx-c a-i-center p-1  color-box-pop-cycle" data-reactid="172"><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 max-w-768px m-a" data-reactid="173"><!-- react-empty: 174 --><!-- react-empty: 175 --><!-- react-empty: 176 --><!-- react-empty: 177 --><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="178"><p data-reactid="179">What are the origins of European integration, and how far back in time do we need to travel to pick up these first stirrings. Do we have to at all?   I&#x27;d like to begin this conversation by taking us back to the Congress of Vienna as this will allow a theoretical discussion on what motivated the nation states at the time to develop a &#x27;Concert of Europe&#x27;  What was the origin of the idea of the balance of power?  How did European leaders apply its principles in actual practice?  If we fast forward to today, can we argue whether the notion of a balance of power still applies within the European region?  Is the balance now a balance based on financial muscle and do the nation states of Europe feel it necessary to balance against Germany&#x27;s new-found power?  Is the EU now centralized sufficiently to prevent the states on the margins from spinning away? Does the very economic union created by the EU encourage the latent nationalism that simmers below the surface in Catalonia and Scotland? Will the Lega Nord  fianlly win independece for the North from the South in Italy?  To my mind, any discussion on concepts such as the balance of power must include a treatment on nationalism and all its ramifications.  This will be the point of departure for this book. </p></div></div></div></section></div><section id="16" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="180"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="181"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="182"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="183"><span data-reactid="184"><!-- react-empty: 185 --><h2 data-reactid="186"><a data-reactid="187">Dr. Harry Stephan</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="188"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="189"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="190"><div class="Link" data-reactid="191"><a data-reactid="192">Dr. Harry Stephan RSS</a></div></div></div></div><div data-reactid="193"></div></section></div></div>

Then third, I have found very interesting material on European culture that is underpinned by nationalism and the relationship of the member states to the EU.   The political leverage, either for convergence or devolution is quite fascinating, and takes me to my core problem right now.   This problem turns on the nature of political unrest within Europe and where this may lead.  There is no doubt in my mind that poor economic performance is leading to solid gains in Greece by the radical right, and we should see more of this within those  states that also begin experiencing economic decline.  Will this change dissipate if Europe can rebound?  Is the link real?    Is the economic structure within the EU governing political change, or can we flip the argument and maintain that political structures are causing the economic malaise on the periphery?  I simply don't know how to formulate the connection.  My concern now is that France will soon become the sick man of Europe.  To my mind, this will result from a problem of France's competitiveness within the Euro area.  Thus it appears that we shall witness more problems in Europe due to the straightjacket maintained by the single currency.  Will France balk and jump away or stay the course? How will this effect the political trajectory towards Balassa's final solution of a single federated Europe? The alternative, France buys into Cameron's notions of political and economic devolution. Something will have to give."}]},"b04bac28-71de-4866-81af-c13cda8fd56e":{"id":"b04bac28-71de-4866-81af-c13cda8fd56e","index":5,"created_by":"cbb3a2eb-e34d-43af-a638-1d4fea6517e8","updated_by":null,"created_at":"2016-04-06T03:49:36.153Z","updated_at":null,"published":true,"score":0,"path":"_posts/2016-04-06-new-theories-of-regionalism.md","_title":"New Theories of Regionalism","metadata":{"@type":"Article","url":"new-theories-of-regionalism/index.html","inLanguage":null,"starred":false,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":true,"inNav":false,"title":"New Theories of Regionalism","keywords":[]},"content":[{"id":"b051f2c6-18f5-4540-8a7d-d04bc50cbd50","item":"b04bac28-71de-4866-81af-c13cda8fd56e","type":"text","html":"<p>Thursdays, as always, involve graduate students.  Such a pleasure setting out arguments, but on this Thursday we debated the nature of regionalism in the East African Community, and especially the work of Eathan B.
