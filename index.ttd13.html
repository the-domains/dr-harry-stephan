Undoubtedly the clash between Catholics and Protestants in the period that some historians describe as ‘The Age of Reason’, dominated the landscape with its incredible brutality. Over 25 percent of the population in the German states, the Low Countries and the Kingdom of Bohemia succumbed to death, destruction and disease.  And now we see similar barbarity in the Middle East as Sunni and Shiite Muslims tear each other apart.  But there is more than just religion in this mindless pursuit of death and destruction.  Saudi Arabia and Iran are squaring off against each other.  The Kurds are developing the capacity and will to carve out their own national state.  ISIS, with visions of a Caliphate, dominates a large swathe of Syria and Iraq.  Thus just as the war in Bohemia began as a religious war, and then degenerated primarily into a battle over the national state interests of France and Hapsburg Austria, so too will this new general war in the Middle East degenerate into a fight over the national interests of various participants in the region.  We can argue that the Treaty of Westphalia succeeded finally because the combatants on all sides simply fought themselves to a standstill. Will this be the case in the Middle East?</p>","metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"starred":false,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"_description":"","keywords":[]}},{"id":"259ed4f4-db03-4c16-b730-9c36e0f83848","item":"9fee6fc0-6907-4ee6-95a7-111bb5e654c8","type":"text","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_text":" In this mindless context of war, a dramatic breakthrough occurred as Iran and the P5+1 (the United States, Great Britain, China, Russia, France plus Germany) reached on Thursday April 2nd, a comprehensive framework to curb Tehran’s nuclear programme while gradually easing international sanctions.  Should the outline agreement hold in the coming weeks, it could pave the way for an historic, final, and comprehensive deal between Iran and the world powers before an end-June 2015 deadline.   To my mind this historic agreement, if successful, will be more significant than President Richard Nixon’s visit to China.  ","_html":"<p> In this mindless context of war, a dramatic breakthrough occurred as Iran and the P5+1 (the United States, Great Britain, China, Russia, France plus Germany) reached on Thursday April 2nd, a comprehensive framework to curb Tehran’s nuclear programme while gradually easing international sanctions.  Should the outline agreement hold in the coming weeks, it could pave the way for an historic, final, and comprehensive deal between Iran and the world powers before an end-June 2015 deadline.   To my mind this historic agreement, if successful, will be more significant than President Richard Nixon’s visit to China.  </p>","metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"starred":false,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"_description":"","keywords":[]}},{"id":"982b8b6f-e1f0-4604-8a18-22f36d459799","item":"9fee6fc0-6907-4ee6-95a7-111bb5e654c8","type":"text","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_text":" For starters, in terms of the Iranian economy, billions are up for grabs.  Andrew Torchia, writing in theKhaleej Timesargues that Iran’s $420 billion economy will experience up to an 8 percent growth in GDP once Tehran rejoins the global economy.  Iran’s trade with the European Union, which totaled $8.3 billion last year, could balloon 400 percent by mid-2018.  Moreover, Iran could increase oil output by 800,000 barrels per day to a full capacity of 3.6 million barrels per day within three months of the sanctions being fully lifted.
