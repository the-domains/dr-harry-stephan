As we are approaching the final hurdle before the exam on Tuesday, I write for a few reasons.  First I would like to thank you for your generous and kind comments on your evaluations.   Second, I want to urge you all to put in that little bit of extra effort to ensure you will do well on the exam.  And third, I would like to provide you with a light interlude from your studies with a youtube link.  Had Plato been alive today, perhaps this would have been his world of illusion.   I am already looking forward to seeing you next year in POL 2039, so please make sure you pass this exam with aplomb!
