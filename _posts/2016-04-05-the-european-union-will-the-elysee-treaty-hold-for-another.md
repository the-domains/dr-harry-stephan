Nationalism as a concept lost ground in the recent past as the idea of the European Union took hold.  But as we probe the crisis of the EU in the 21st Century, can we honestly argue that nationalism is a dead issue?  In the period following the Great Depression we witnessed the rise of the Iron Guard in Romania, the Falangist movement  in Spain and Fascism under Benito Mussolini in Italy. What of Golden Dawn in Greece today, and can we argue with certainty that populists and parties of the right will not dominate politics in Europe again? 

I want to invite you to argue a case for the European Union.  I see the issue as a fugue that requires arguments on both sides.  Nothing is simple.  Do we follow the 'Oder Democracy' of Angela Merkel , for example, or has David Cameron struck a cord for devolution that will resonate through the corridors of power within the region? 

I am posting this blog in an attempt to get those of you with an idea of where the EU will  end up, to actually write your ideas  here.  I want to create a forum that will tap into the collective knowledge of those who have studied this issue.  I have thought about this for some time.  For so long, if we wanted to write a book, we sat in isolation  and ignored the collective wisdom around us.  I feel that you have a lot to offer and I want your input, whether it's one word or 100 pages.  Don't get me wrong for one moment.  I am still the editor of my own thoughts, but I have been asked to address the issue of the European Union going forward, and when I think back on the commentary of students at UCT in my Graduate classes, who am I to dismiss your scholarship?  So I am developing this blog with an idea that I would like to challenge you all to contribute as a collective think tank.  I'll set out a spine, or if you will a general outline, and my challenge today is to tap your intellect to find out whether you as graduates at UCT can create an outstanding intellectual accomplishment that will knock the socks off the academic world. Anyone of you who contributes will get an acknowledgement in the final publication.  Who's in?   I am asking you to take the time to join in a collective effort.   I have been teaching at the graduate level for over 20 years.  Now I want to see where you have ended up intellectually.   I shall begin running my ideas shortly.
