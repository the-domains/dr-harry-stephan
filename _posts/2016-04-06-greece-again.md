WIll the Greek government vote a budget that crushes the Greeks yet again?  Greece is predicted to fall short at Euro 2.5-billion this year, so cuts have to be made.  Yet the Greek government is hanging on with a margin of just four seats, and the Greeks are no longer willing to make any more sacrifices on the alter of EU austerity.  If a budget does pass that includes the required cuts, expect massive riots. 

Can Europe afford the social unrest and will the paymaster-in-chief, Angela Merkel give just a wee bit of ground? I think a confederation, like the Zollverein, with a dual currency, may prove a better solution.
