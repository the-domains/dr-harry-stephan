Over the past months, I have focused attention on two core issues: The Greek debt crisis, which has dogged the European Union for years, and the Nuclear Deal with Iran, which has polarized politics in the United States.  

Both the Greek debt issue and the Nuclear Deal with Iran are now going to go through, notwithstanding domestic opposition in Germany to the Greek bailout and domestic opposition in the United States where Republicans are threatening a life and death issue for America.  

To my mind, the Greek debt issue will not go away and will continue to be a thorn in the European Union's side.  The IMF has made no bones about the fact that Greek debt is not sustainable, and thus this issue will still need more resolution.  What is more positive, however, is the reaction we should see to the Iranian Nuclear Deal.  This deal could  really overshadow Nixon's visit to China as it has such immense implications, both in the commercial world and diplomatically.  There is much to think about now, and the Middle East is fast becoming a very interesting ground for further study.
